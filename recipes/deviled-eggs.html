<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Deviled eggs, also known as stuffed eggs, curried eggs or dressed eggs,
     are hard-boiled eggs that have been peeled, cut in half, and 
     filled with the yolk, mixed with other ingredients such as 
     mayonnaise and mustard. They are generally served cold as a side dish,
      appetizer, or a main course during gatherings or parties.</p>
<p>The dish's origin can be seen in recipes for boiled, seasoned eggs as
     far back as ancient Rome, where they were traditionally served
      as a first course. The dish is popular in Europe, North America and Australia.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Smoked paprika, for garnish</li>
</ul>      

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover with enough water that there's 1 1/2 inches of water above the eggs. Heat on high until water begins to boil, then cover, turn the heat to low, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and leave covered for 14 minutes, then rinse under cold water continuously for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Crack egg shells and carefully peel under cool running water. Gently dry with paper towels. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise, removing yolks to a medium bowl, and placing the whites on a serving platter. Mash the yolks into a fine crumble using a fork. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper, and mix well.</li>
    <li>Evenly disperse heaping teaspoons of the yolk mixture into the egg whites. Sprinkle with paprika and serve.</li>
</ol>
