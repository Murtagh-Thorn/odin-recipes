Initial: I am about to begin a project called "Recipes" that is intended to showcase the HTML topics covered thus far in TOP. Cheers to my first TOP project!
Post completion: For the first set of instructions based on the Recipes project, I created my home page and linked three different recipe files all created myself. Tasks practiced: CL repository creation, boilerplate HTML file creation, HTML headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, img embedding, linking HTML files to the home page, creating GitHub repo, staging, committing, and pushing from local source to GitHub repo, and Git commit messages.
